- Semantic HTML5

## Plan on improving the project

:)

I think this project could look a tad better if it was not that sectiony, if we can somehow ease the transition between the sections it would look a ton better.

insert some gifs instead of the static images and make the nav bar follow with a fixed position on the top is also a great idea in my opinion, it should let you look around way more easier.
